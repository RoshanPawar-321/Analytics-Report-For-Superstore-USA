I have developed an interactive Superstore Analytics Report using Tableau, providing comprehensive insights into sales performance, customer behavior, and regional trends. This dashboard features key metrics such as total sales, profit margins, top-performing product categories, and customer segmentation. It includes visualizations like heatmaps, trend analysis, and geographical sales distribution to help businesses make data-driven decisions. By analyzing sales patterns and profitability, this report enables better strategic planning and business optimization.
